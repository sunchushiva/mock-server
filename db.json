      "instructions": "Bench press is a great exercise for building a powerful chest. \n The bench press is one of the power exercises, known to be very effective for building body mass. Learning how to do a proper bench press is well worth the effort. \n Steps : \n 1.) Lie with your back flat on a bench with your feet firmly on the ground and the bar resting on the bench’s rack. \n 2.) Slowly lift the bar off the rack and hold it above your chest as this will be the starting position. \n 3.) Then lower the bar down until it is slightly above your chest, making sure that it doesn't touch or slam against your chest. \n  4.) Hold this position briefly and make sure you have complete control of the bar, then raise it back up to the starting position. \n  3.) Place the bar on the rack and that will complete your set. \n  Tips : \n  1.) Changing the width of the bar's grip will change the exercise's focus and targeting. Using a medium grip is the most common grip on the bar which is slightly wider than the shoulder width that is typically marked on the bar. \n 2.) Using a spotter while performing this exercise is essential to make sure that the bar doesn't drop onto your chest and a spotter can provide motivation to lift more weight. \n 3.) The most important thing about the bench press exercise is using a weight that you can manage while maintaining proper form. Many individuals try to lift more weight than they can manage which results in injuring and incorrectly performing the exercise.",

      "instructions": "This exercise uses unique and variable resistance to target your chest and biceps. \n  Steps : \n  1.) Take a resistance band and wrap it around a straight pole or the post of an exercise machine. Keeping the band at around chest level, face away from the post and hold the handles in each hand, spreading them out to your sides. \n 2.) Once you have wrapped the band around the pole, step back until you feel resistance, standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, and keep your knees bent and abs tight. \n  3.) To perform the exercise, slowly allow your hands to come in towards each other, keeping your arms extended out in front of you, until you feel a stretch in your chest. \n 4.) Hold this position for a few seconds then return back to the starting position with your hands extended out and handles spread out at your sides. \n Tips : \n 1.) By using a straight pole, it provides stability to perform the exercise and less likely to slip thus injuring yourself. \n  2.) You are able to vary the resistance by either stepping towards or away from where the band is wrapped around.",

      "instructions": "Targeting your traps and deltoids, the barbell upright row is an important shoulder strengthening exercise. \n Steps : \n 1.) Start by standing up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. \n 2.) Grab the barbell with an overhand grip (your palms facing towards you). \n 3.) Once you have a grip, raise the bar towards your chin, elevating and contracting from your shoulders and traps, until it is about collarbone level. \n 4.) As soon as you reach the top position, hold for a count then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. \n Tips : \n 1.) If possible and available, try performing this exercise while using a rack, you will be able to rest the weight on the rack and pick it up from a more comfortable position without injuring yourself or pulling your muscles. \n 2.) Prevent dropping your shoulders \n 3.) Keeping your abs tight will help protect your back during the upright row. \n 4.) Using a shoulder-width grip and maintaining good posture while performing this exercise is key. \n 5.) Holding onto the bar with a narrow grip will help target the trap muscles more but in the turn will make you more prone to shoulder injury.",

The research looked at the efficacy of foam rolling and a core strengthening program on different athletic and health outcomes. \n The results from the original program, based on 2 weekly sessions for 8-weeks, concluded the following: \n 1. Eight weeks of core-stability training two times per week improved dorsal trunk strength with no changes in a foam rolling group or the control. \n 2. Hamstring flexibility was improved both by an eight-week core-strength and foam rolling training intervention. \n In this Jefit core program, the first four weeks use less intensity and overall time and include 5 core exercises. In weeks 5-8, the focus is on similar core movements with longer old times, slight progressions, and about a 2-minute longer workout session.\n Jefit combined the program into one four-week program to make things easier.",

The workout time is about 35 minutes. \n Day 2: Complete another 6 bodyweight exercises for session 2. Workout time is also about 35 minutes. \n *Note: The first exercise in each of these days should be performed for 30 seconds each (not reps.) so have your interval timer on.

The final cardio of the day is used to burn even more calories for optimal fat loss.",
